# TestFx
There is a read me we provided in the Final deliverables folder. We will also provide them here as well. 

 

For the jar file there are two things needed 

JAVA FX 

Microsoft access  

 

1, Open the command prompt/ terminal then go in the directory of where the jar file is on your local machine 

2, Run this command we have provided 

java --module-path "This is where JavaFx lib is on your local machine" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics -jar Resturaunt.jar 

  

Also, you can test and temporarily remove the database file if you want to see the error message that pops up on the screen.
